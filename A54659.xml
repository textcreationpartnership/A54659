            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HAT the occaſion of the following Diſcourſe is, thou mayeſt ſee before, <hi>viz.</hi> the death of one that laboured abundantly in the Work of the Lord, yet not he, but the grace of God that was with him, whom the Lord, in teſtimony of high diſpleaſure to the ſurvivers, took away to himſelf in the midſt of his dayes and Work; and thereby hath occaſioned and increaſed mourning and lamentation in the daughter of his <hi>Judah.</hi> Oh! that while he is thus lifting up his hand, we may ſee wherefore he is thus contending with us, that we may turn to him that ſmiteth, and ſeek the Lord of hoſts, leſt his wrath further break forth as fire, and devour, and there be none to quench it.</p>
            <p>He was one that was not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, for he knew, that it is the power of God to ſalvation to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth; and therefore he determined to know nothing elſe, in, and unto all things, ſave Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified, as he is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently therein ſet before us, and pourtrayed unto us; and did not preach himſelf, but Jeſus Chriſt the Lord; nor was his zeal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed about indifferent things, or lighter matters, for he was well aſſured that the Kingdom of God is not meat and drink (and ſo, not dayes, and times, and places, and geſtures, and circumſtances, and ſuch things as periſh with the uſing) but righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt; and therefore did in theſe great things of God's Law ſerve Chriſt, and ſo was acceptable to God, and profitable to men; he was even ſet for the defence and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel, and that was to him the joy and rejoycing of his heart; and he had all his confidence begun and ſtrengthned from the kindneſs and love of God our Saviour to mankind, and his feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:102274:3"/>
upon the fleſh of Chriſt that was given for the life of the World, and the grace of God therein commended, by which Jeſus Chriſt taſted death for every man, and in the vertue of his blood is raiſed again in that ſame body in which he bare our ſins on the Tree; this was the beginning of his confidence, (and not ſome ſecret thing with him, or peculiar manner of love to him) the reaſon of his hope, the anſwer of his good conſcience towards God, the foundation of his faith and hope, the argument by which he was reconciled to God, and strengthned to look for the mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto eternal life; and where-through his heart was purified and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled to the unfeigned love of the brethren, and to the love of all men, yea of his enemies; from hence his hearts deſire and prayer to God for them was, that they might be ſaved. The love of Chriſt did conſtrain him to perſwade men, and pray them to be reconciled to God, and receive his grace to purpoſe, whether he were looked upon as one beſides himſelf, or as a ſober man, becauſe he thus judged, that if one died for all, then were all dead, and he died for all, that they which live ſhould not henceforth live to themſelves, but to him that died for them, and roſe again. In preaching the word he was inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, and was (to that end that Chriſt might be magnified, and therein mens good indeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and eſpecially the profit of the houſhold of faith purſued) in journeying often—in wearineſs and painfulneſs, in watchings often, &amp;c. Who was weak, and he was not weak? Who was offended, and he burned not? And in preaching Christ he did warn every man (as he had opportunity) and teach every man in all wiſdom, that he might preſent every man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus: Whereunto he did alſo labour, ſtriving according to his working which wrought in him mightily. He hath fought the good fight, he hath finiſhed his courſe, he hath kept the faith; henceforth there is laid up for him a crown of righteouſneſs, which the Lord the righteous judge ſhall give to him at that day, and not to him only, but alſo to all them that love his appearing.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs God in ſuch ſtrokes is ſignifying his great diſpleaſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with us, in removing ſo untimely one ſo much framed to a like mindedneſs with himſelf in Chriſt, whoſe heart was fixed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the good of all men, eſpecially of them that believe, ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the mind of the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, eſpecially of them that believe, 1 Tim. 4. 10. As if he were hereby beginning to riſe up out of his wonted place of mercy, and
<pb facs="tcp:102274:3"/>
to for ſake us, and wo will be to us when he depart eth from us. Oh! that we may conſider his work, and the operation of his hands, leſt he deſtroy us, and not build us up. In this day ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ely the Lord God of hoſts is calling to mourning, and to weeping, and to baldneſs, and to girding with ſackcloath. Oh! that there may not be beheld a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us joy and gladneſs, ſlaying Oxen, and killing ſheep, eating fleſh, and drinking wine; But, O daughter of <hi>Zion,</hi> let tears run down like a River day and night, give thy ſelf no rest, let not the apple of thine eyes ceaſe. Ariſe, cry out in the night, in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord, lift up thine hands towards him. He hath trodden under foot thy mighty men; for this thou haſt cauſe to weep, that thou ſhouldſt procure ſuch teſtimonies of diſpleaſure to thy ſelf, and that thine eye, thine eye, ſhould run down with water, becauſe the Comforter that ſhould relieve thy ſoul, is far from thee.</p>
            <p>Oh! that we may yet turn again to the Lord. We have ſtill a Lord to turn to, when the ſervants are removed; the great ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd to direct our eyes and hearts to, when under-ſhepherds are taken away: And to whom ſhould a people ſeek but to their God? The Lord liveth, though the Fathers are gone, and Prophets do not live for ever; with him is no variableneſs nor ſhadow of turning: And we have yet incouragement to look to him, for he is gracious and merciful, ſlow to anger, and of great kindneſs, and repenteth him of the evil, Joel 2. 13. There is no God like unto him that pardoneth iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſion of the remnant of his heritage; he retaineth not his anger for ever, becauſe he delighteth in mercy, <hi>M c. 7. 18.</hi> Let us then lift up our hearts with our hands to God in the higheſt, with whom is forgiveneſs, that he may be feared; plenteouſneſs of redemption, that he may be hoped in by us; for the Lord will not caſt off for ever: But though he cauſe grief, he will have compaſſion according to the multitude of his mercies; for he doth not willingly afflict nor grieve the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, <hi>Lam. 3. 31, 32, 33.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in our turning to him, let us ſearch and try our hearts and wayes, and turn from the things reproved, and which he is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering us to be guilty of, and polluted with, otherwiſe we ſhall but turn to him feignedly, and not with the whole heart, <hi>Jer. 3. 10.</hi> If we will return, let us return to him, and put away our abomixa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions out of his ſight, <hi>Jer. 4. 1.</hi> To this end it is that the Lord's voice is crying to the City, O that we may be men of wiſdom, to ſee
<pb facs="tcp:102274:4"/>
his Name, and hear his Rod, and who hath appointed it, <hi>Mica. 6. 9, 13.</hi> O that that alſo may not be verified concerning us, which the Prophet confeſſeth with ſhame they were guilty of, that though all this evil is come upon us, yet (though we aſſemble together, and ſeek him, and pray to him, yea ſeek him daily, and take delight in approaching to him) we have not made this our prayer unto God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and underſtand his truth, <hi>Dan. 9. 13.</hi> all his debatings with us are to this end, that our iniquity may be purged, and this is all the fruit, to take away our ſin, <hi>Iſa. 27. 8, 9.</hi> And if we receive not this end of his, we ſhall ſtill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to watch upon a further evil, and bring it upon us. Shall one take up a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But if we be not reformed by theſe things, but will walk contrary to him, he will alſo walk contrary to us, and puniſh us yet ſeven times for our ſins, <hi>Lev. 26. 23, 24.</hi> it will even provoke him at laſt to ſend a famine of hearing the words of the Lord, to remove all left that are in any meaſure faithful in ſeeking the good of others, and to deliver the reſidue to the multitude. And this was that which was much dreaded and deprecated by our Brother, a little before his being removed from amongſt us, and hath been ſince threatned, in ſome meaſure, once and again; but hitherto in great mercy, and in a great meaſure he hath withdrawn his hand, and wrought wonderfully, that his name might not be polluted. Oh! that, becauſe ſentence againſt our evil work is not ſpeedily executed, our hearts may not be ſet in us to do evil; but that we may by his goodneſs be led to repentance, and run together unto the Lord, and with one another, and in the acknowledging and for ſaking our iniquities, cry mightily unto him whom mercy pleaſeth, that he may forgive our ſins, and heal our breaches, and be merciful unto, and ſpare the remnant of his heritage, and make them bleſſings in thoſe ſeveral parts of the field, where the wiſe and gracious ſower hath ſowed them, and that the commandment may be kept without ſpot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>1 Tim. 6. 12, 14.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The following Treatiſe hath been ſeveral moneths at the Preſs, and met with manifold obstructions, otherwiſe thou mighteſt ſooner have ſeen it. Poſſibly it hath ſtuck ſo long there, that we, who are ſo apt to forget the blow when the rod is taken off, might be again

awakened to ſome freſh remembrance and conſideration of the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſeverity of it, and the greater judgments threatned in it.

How faithful was he in declaring the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Jeſus, as delivered by the Apoſtles, and for many years warning therewith; and notwithſtanding the reproaches and ſufferings he indured from men and exerciſes he met with from brethren and the burden of his family and others with him, even the weak (for his hands miniſtred to his neceſſities

Nor do I mention this of our Brothers labouring to ſhame any; but if in mentioning it, my ſelf, or others be reproved, and God ſet it home, let us not reject it, but take ſhame to our ſelves that our care was no more toward him, that he might have been at more liberty to have attended the things of Chriſt: and ſtill it was more blameworthy, if any raiſed or received any falſe reports that they might hereby cloak their covetouſneſs, and ſhut up the bowels of others) yet his heart was exerciſed for the good of all, and eſpecially good of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and ſo exerciſed, as that his body and members were imployed herein to admiration, conſidering his great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and many infirmities, he did gladly ſpend himſelf, and was ſpent for others good, oh that there were no reaſon to adde the following words in, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 15.</p>

            <p>1. The time when he thus ſolemnly reſignes them; <hi>Now,</hi> namely,</p>
            <p>1. When they were full of heavineſs, and ſorrow had filled their hearts becauſe of his departure from them for ever, as to any further perſonall viſiting of them, or being viſited by them, he did not ceaſe or fail from among the children of men (as our Brother, the removall of whom was the occaſion of this diſcourſe, doth) but was ſo taken away from them, that he ſhould be no more of any perſonal uſefulneſs to them, as to his bodily preſence amongſt them, for they ſhould ſee his face

no more. Oh this is a time of wailing, and heavineſs, when God is taking away faithful ones in the midſt of their dayes, or work, a day of trouble, and perplexity by the Lord God of Hoſts in the valley of viſion, Where the viſion of all, even the viſion of all viſions, and that in which all may ſee themſelves concerned, the teſtimony of Chriſt, in which (eſpecially and fundamentally in the firſt branch of it) there is declared ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of great joy to all people, hath run and flowed abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, like a River in low places, to the cauſing fatneſs, and fruitfulneſs, Iſay, there, a day of perplexity, breaking down the walls that his judgements may break in, threatning to pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And the Lord God of Hoſts in this day is calling to weeping, and to mourning, eſpecially thoſe that are devout perſons, fearers of him, <hi>Iſa. 22 4 5. 12. Acts</hi> 8. 2. And thus were theſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed to whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks as <hi>ver.</hi> 37. 38. They all wept <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ore, and fell on <hi>Pauls</hi> neck, and kiſſed him; ſorrowing moſt of all, for he words that he ſpake, that they ſhould ſee his face no more, it might have occaſioned heavineſs though he had departed but for a ſeaſon; but they ſorrowed moſt of all becauſe they ſhould ſee his face no more, and becauſe hereby a way was made, not only for Gods anger to break forth more immediately: but for evil men, and ſeducers to come in amongſt them, as <hi>ver. 29. 30 Iſa. 57 1. 4. 5. Pſal.</hi> 12. 1. 4. And now they might with ſadneſs remember how they had failed in ſhewing forth Love to him, ſo as his hands had miniſtred to his own neceſſity, and thoſe that were with him; Yet now when they were thus full of grief, he thus reſigns and commends them to God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To ſignifie;</p>
            <p>That when faithful and eminent watchmen, and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of help are taken away, and ſorrow is thereby greatly occaſioned, this is now proper to moderate our grief, that we ſorrow not as thoſe that have no hope, That he that keepeth Iſrael ſhall never ſlumber, nor ſleep, the Lord liveth, and is faithful to keep our ſouls, ſupply all wants, and perfect what concerns us, when the good man is removed, or periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Earth. This therefore he now ſpeaks, that they might not be ſwallowed up with overmuch grief, he ſpeaks it not to prevent all ſorrow, it is meet to be humbled

And it is an evidence of great hardneſs, and inſenſibleneſs, when Gods hand is ſo highly lifted up, not to ſee, or take notice of what he is reproving, <hi>Iſa</hi> 26. 11. and 57. 1.

When man had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and brought themſelves under the ſentence of baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, God's love and pity was toward them; but ſuch was the holineſs of God, and his truth, and juſtice, that there was no mercy to be ſhewed forth to mankind, until his juſtice was ſatisfied, his truth fulfilled, and his righteous Law anſwered; <hi>For heaven and earth ſhall paſs away, but not one jot, or title of the Law ſhall paſs till all be fulfilled.</hi> But now Jeſus Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming under the Law by the will of God, he bare our ſins, and dyed our death, and is raiſed again, ſo as in him mercy and truth are met, righteouſneſs and peace have kiſſed; truth is ſprung out of the earth in his reſurrection, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs looks down from heaven, in all the ſtreams of God's goodneſs and compaſſion to us; and now there is cauſe to ſing, peace in heaven, and glory in the higheſt; he is aſcended upon high, and is ſet down at the right hand of the throne of the Majeſty, in the heavens.

His end in his having made peace, was,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102274:27"/>
that he might reconcile all things, and ſo all men (as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſometimes is included and meant in that expreſſion, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 21, 23.) Col.</hi> 1. 20. And indeed that his end was to reconcile all men, appears to be included in that expreſſion, in that he immediately adds, <hi>And you who were ſometimes ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and alienated in your minds, &amp;c. yet now hath he reconciled, Col. 1. 20, 21. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15. and ſo his end in what God hath now appointed Chriſt to, and in which he is faithful, is the ſame, not to condemn the world, but that through him the world might be ſaved; and the Apoſtle doth hereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate and prove the graciouſneſs of God's heart towards all men, by ſhewing what he hath appointed Chriſt unto in his preſent work and office. <hi>God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>will have all men to be ſaved', and come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> To evidence that, he ſaith; <hi>For there is one God,</hi> (namely, not only to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh him from all other who are called Gods, but to denote to us that he is one, not divided, hath not a ſecret will contrary to his revealed, but he is light, and in him is no dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at all, and ſo he is the ſame, he hath manifeſted himſelf to be in abaſing his Son to dye for us, and crowning him with glory and honour, that he by the grace of God ſhould taſte death for every man.) <hi>And one Mediator,</hi> (namely, as before, not only to diſtinguiſh him from all others that are called ſo, and ſo to ſignifie that he is the one and only Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor appointed by the one God; though that is true, and may be principally intended, but alſo to aſſure us that he is one, the ſame, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the ſame, yesterday, to day, and for ever, Heb.</hi> 13. 8. And ſo in what he is appointed to, to day, he is one and the ſame with what he was yeſterday, even the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the world, the anointed Saviour of men, while they are not wholly given up to, and become one with Satan, and reckoned fully of his ſeed, and for ſuch in that conſideration he was never a Saviour; and ſo he is one Mediator) <hi>between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus</hi> (even he that had ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite grace to all men, that) <hi>he gave himſelf a ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due time,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 4 6. If God had not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and deſired that all men ſhould be ſaved, he would never have appointed ſuch a gracious Mediator between him and them, and ſuch a faithful teſtimony: Now then to this end that men might be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102274:28"/>
truth in this day, and this in order unto their eternal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>1. Jeſus Chriſt is a teſtimony of God's graciouſneſs to men in due time, even to all men as they come to years of capacity, that they might be reconciled, and their hearts turned to the Lord; the enmity that was in the ſtate and condition of mankind, Jeſus Chriſt hath already ſlain, and hath taken out of the way all that was in it contrary to us; but yet ſtill men while abiding in their natural ſtate, are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in their minds to God; there is a ſecret enmity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety in their hearts to God, through that ignorance that is in them. Now then, that this may be purged out, and their minds turned to the Lord, Jeſus Chriſt is ſeaſonably by all means witneſſing his, and his Fathers pity and love to them, and is by his goodneſs diſcovered moving to repentance, for it is the goodneſs of God leadeth to repentance, even thoſe that are not led by it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4, 5. It is his love manifeſted and diſcerned that begets love to him again, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 7, 10, 19. Grace is poured into the lips of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 2. and he is in ſome meaſure giving ſome witneſſings of God's mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifulneſs and goodneſs to all; yea, to thoſe that had not the Word and Oracles committed to them, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the fleſh had: <hi>He left not himſelf without witneſs</hi> (of his propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs through a Mediator) <hi>but gave them rain from heaven, and fruitful ſeaſons, filling their hearts with food and gladneſs, Act.</hi> 14. 17. &amp; 17. 26, 27. that which may be known of God is manifeſt in them, for God hath ſhewed it unto them; for the inviſible things of him, from the Creation of the world, are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead, even his mercy, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and wiſdom, &amp;c. That he is, and is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him, which whoever believes, having no more clear diſcovery, comes to God acceptably, <hi>Rom. 1. 19, 21. Pſal. 19. 1, 6. &amp; 145. 8, 10. Heb.</hi> 11. 6.

And ſo it is ſaid, the Spirit of the Lord God is upon Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe the Lord hath anointed him to preach the Goſpel, &amp;c. and ſo to preach it as to comfort all that mourn, as diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Zions</hi> mourners, even all that mourn, whatever be the occaſion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1, 2. and without controverſie he is without ſin here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; he is faithful in what he is appointed to, yea not only faithful from the ingagement and obligation of an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but his own gracious heart and cordial affection to all, moves him ſo to be, for he is the Son of the Father in love. Hence that, <hi>Good and upright is the Lord, therefore will he teach ſinners in the way,</hi> Pſal. 25. 8, 9. He is not ſimply upright, but good, gracious, and thence alſo upright; therefore will he teach ſuch as are out of the way, even ſuch as have miſſed the way, and mark, as diſtinguiſhed from meek ones, and fearers of the Lord.</p>
            <p>And in and with his witneſſings of God's goodneſs, he is alſo faithfully reproving and convincing men of the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſin, and of the vanity of their idols; he is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto them the emptineſs and unprofitableneſs of all thoſe things in which naturally they are ſeeking reſt.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102274:29"/>
not ſimply reprove, but makes all things manifeſt, it diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things in their right and proper colours, that men might flee from the things reproved; wherefore he ſaith, <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt</hi> (that haſt fellowſhip with men in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful works of darkneſs) <hi>and ariſe from the dead,</hi> (both from dead perſons and things, forſake the fooliſh) <hi>and Chriſt ſhall give thee light,</hi> Eph. 5. 13, 14. <hi>Prov.</hi> 9. 6. It is the work and office of the Holy Ghoſt to reprove and convince the world of ſin, becauſe they believe not on Chriſt, of righteouſneſs, and of judgment; and this he doth by glorifying Chriſt, and taking of his things, and ſhewing unto men, <hi>John</hi> 16. 8, 14, 15.</p>
            <p>And together with this diſcovery of God's goodneſs to all in due time vouchſafed, and reproof of mens evils, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the ſinfulneſs of their ſin, and emptineſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableneſs of their objects of reſt and ſatisfying, in which in vain they ſeek what is not in them, Jeſus Chriſt is alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting men in due time with ſome capacity to behold what he is commending to them, and what he is condemning and faulting: <hi>This is the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world,</hi> Joh. 1. 9.

the condemnation (viz.</hi> the cauſe of condemnation, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning ſin, and that which makes all ſins condemnable, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of Goſpel) <hi>that light is come into the world</hi> (ſome diſcovery and manifeſtation of God's goodneſs afforded, and ſome capacity to behold it given) <hi>and men loved darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds were evil</hi> (ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to be by the light) <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 17, 19. And certainly no man ſhall be condemned to a ſecond death, but for refuſing the grace of God that brings ſalvation to ſave them in due time, and perſiſting therein. As our Saviour ſaith to the <hi>Jews; If I had not come and ſpoken unto them, they had not had ſin, but now they have no cloak or excuſe for their ſin,</hi> Joh. 15. 22.</p>
            <p>And this is great conſolation to us, that Jeſus Chriſt is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be, and is the light of the world, for he is good and upright; any man is unmeet for this, though he were never ſo willing, yet he is unable to ſpeak to all men; yea, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is not put upon them to give forth or diſpenſe to others; this glory he will not give to another beſides Jeſus Chriſt, nor his praiſe to graven images, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 6, 8. It is true, they are inſtruments in his hand, and though they have no ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of themſelves as of themſelves to do any good, yet their ſufficiency is of God, and Jeſus Chriſt hath promiſed to be alwayes with his people in their faithful miniſtration, even to the end of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18, 20.</p>
            <p>But however unable men are, yet ſeeing God hath given him to be a light of the Gentiles, that he ſhould be for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the ends of the earth, he will not fail, nor be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged; and this grace of his, and of the Father in him, is diſcovered to us in this word of his grace.</p>
            <p>2. He is alſo the Mediator between God and men, making interceſſion for tranſgreſſors, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 12. that is to ſay, when men after ſome manifeſtation of God's goodneſs afforded, leading to repentance, and ſome capacity given to behold it, and men ſtrengthned to turn from darkneſs to light, yet they are found rebelling againſt the light, and grace of God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed, and provoke new wrath; now that men might not be preſently cut off, and bound over to the wrath to come, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their deſerts, he is appearing in heaven for them, that God may be ſtill patient toward them, and not deal with them according to their ſins: It is generally found with men
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102274:30"/>
that they are ſinning againſt the grace of God bringing ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to them; the Lord (after means uſed, and mercies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded) looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to ſee if there were any that did underſtand and ſeek God: <hi>They are all gone aſide, they are together become filthy, there is none that doth good, no not one,</hi> Pſal. 14. 2, 3. they are not believing God in what he is teſtifying to them of his goodneſs in and through Jeſus Chriſt, or however, not in what he is therewith teſtifying of them, their works, wayes and idols. And <hi>he that believeth not the Son is condemned already, becauſe he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God;</hi> that is, not ſo believed as to love the light more than darkneſs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 18, 19. And this is generally the reaſon of mens refuſing and rebelling againſt the light, not ſimply becauſe it diſcovers good of God, and declares his graciouſneſs and deſire of mens good, but becauſe it teſtifies of the world that the works thereof are evil, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 7. even their beſt works as well as their worſt works: <hi>He that doth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved and diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> Joh. 3. 20. Job 23. 13, 17. and for this men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, they do deſerve, and are under the ſentence of the wrath to come; this is the ſin of the world, and for which it ſhall be condemned, ſo perſiſting. Now Jeſus Chriſt in his preſent work is preſenting himſelf in the vertues of his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice once offered, and alwayes acceptable before the Father for ſuch as theſe, during his good pleaſure, that judgment may not ſpeedily be executed upon them, but patience and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance may be exerciſed, further means uſed, and ſpirit ſent forth in the means to open their eyes, and to turn them from their diſobedience to the wiſdom of the juſt; he is the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſin of the world, even their ſin of unbelief, for this is the ſin of the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 29. with Chap. 16. 8, 9. that is, he in his preſent Mediation ſo takes it away, that God's wrath may not preſently break forth to cut men off in their ſins; and ſo in a lower ſenſe he procures forgiveneſs for them; not ſuch as they receive who come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God by Chriſt, for their ſins are blotted out in heaven, but the ſins of theſe are retained in heaven againſt them while they con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And (as before is intimated) his end in making interceſſion it is, not only that mens lives might be a little longer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, much leſs is it that he may aggravate their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (though if men ſtill refuſe and rebel, their condemnation will be hereby aggravated, and God will wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy ſcalpe of ſuch as go on ſtill in their treſpaſſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 18, 21.) but that they which live, and have their lives prolonged, might live, not to themſelves, but to him who dyed for them, and roſe again, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15. and therefore while he intercedes for further ſparing, it is that he may dig about (by his corrections and chaſtenings, in which he hath a gracious end while it is called to day, <hi>Job</hi> 7. 17, 18. &amp; 33. 19, 29.) and dung them, with his mercies and goodneſs to lead them to tepentance, as <hi>Luk</hi> 1. 3. 6, 8.

This is the Pſalm or ſong for the Sabbath day, I hat God hath made Chriſt glad through his work, in delivering him and us in him from all our enemies, and exalting his horn like that of an Unicorn, and anointing him with freſh oyl, with the oyl of gladneſs above his fellows; this is the day which the Lord hath made, they ſhall then for ever be glad, and rejoyce in and for it, <hi>Pſal</hi> 92. 1, 4, 10. &amp; 118. 21, 24.</p>
            <p>And that he hath redeemed them unto God by his bloud (in diſcovering the preciouſneſs of it in his teſtimony, and teſtimonies of his goodneſs) out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and Nation, when they were ſometimes of them, and ſo of the world, children of wrath by nature, even as others; yet then God, who is rich in mercy, for the great love wherewith he loved them when dead in ſins, quickned them together with Chriſt, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1, 5. for this they are now inſtructed to ſing <hi>Allelujah,</hi> Pſal. 135. 1, 4. <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for the Lord is good, ſing praiſes to his name, for it is pleaſant; for the Lord hath choſen</hi> Jacob <hi>unto himſelf, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>for his peculiar treaſure; they ſhall then gloriouſly triumph in the works of his hands, which he is now working, in leading forth his people which he hath redeemed out of the world,</hi> Exod. 15. 13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. 4, 5. and the Lord himſelf ſhall rejoyce in his works, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 31.</p>

If I be righteous,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job, yet I will not lift up my head, Job</hi> 10. 15. Thoſe holy men that truſted in God have been ſo far from commending themſelves in this ſenſe, that they have abaſed themſelves in God's preſence, and prayed him not to condemn them, <hi>Job</hi> 10. 2. not to enter into judgment with them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142. 2. and have intimately acknowledged, that if God ſhould mark iniquities, none could ſtand as approved and juſtified before him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. 3, 4 7. and our Saviour inſtructs his Diſciples to ſay, when they have done all thoſe things which are commanded them, we are unprofitable ſervants, we have done that which was our duty to do, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 10. and not to praiſe themſelves, or one another. But the word [commend] doth here and elſewhere ſignifie a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting a perſon or thing to the care or cuſtody of another, to betruſt one with ſuch or ſuch a thing or perſon; and ſo to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102274:45"/>
commit and commend ſeem to be uſed indifferently: So when it is ſaid in one place, <hi>Into thy hand I commit my ſpirit;</hi> in another, our Saviour, as it appears, referring thereto, ſaith, <hi>Into thine hands I commend my ſpirit, Pſal.</hi> 31. 6. with <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 46. and ſo the Apoſtle commendeth theſe to God, &amp;c. to be taught, directed, cared for and preſerved, and ſo unto and for all things as the needs of their matters did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
            <p>2. Now then in that he ſaith [I commend you] therein is imported, ſomething as to the perſon and thing to which he commits them, ſomething as to himſelf who did thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them, ſomething as to the perſons he thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>
            <p>1. As to the perſon and thing to which he commends them, there is intimated therein.</p>
            <p>1. A willingneſs and readineſs to take the charge and care of thoſe committed to him; amongſt men they commit not a perſon or thing to any one that is not willing to receive that truſt; and much leſs can any commend to him, unleſs he were graciouſly willing to receive them, and that he is ſo, hath been the deſign of what is ſpoken, to evidence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate; and it is ſhewn abundantly in the word of his grace. He is one that hath greatly loved us when dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, and manifeſted his love in laying down his life for us; yea, and made it known in due time through preaching, and firſt prevented us with it, when we ſought not after him, he manifeſted himſelf to them that asked not after him, and will in no wiſe caſt off him that cometh, but loves them with peculiar manner of love, even with ſuch manner of love as wherewith the Father loves him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 9, 10. he receives them, and will be a father to them; and theſe were by the father already committed to him, and his peculiar care; he was their ſhepherd that had bought them, and was rich in mercy to them; he hath an high account of ſuch, and hath ſet his heart and eye upon them; yea he is one that is eſpecially ready to receive thoſe of this choſen generation committed to him, when he takes away thoſe that have been inſtruments of help to them, he is a refuge for the oppreſſed; a refuge in the time of trouble, even then after a peculiar conſideration, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 9. he is an helper of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102274:46"/>
the fatherleſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 14. a father of the fatherleſs, a judge of the widows (of thoſe that are deſolate) is God in his holy habitation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 4, 5. in him the fatherleſs find mercy, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 3. and now when he takes away ſuch as have been eminent helpers to them, he is then abundantly ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thoſe that are committed, and do commit themſelves to him: So much he ſignifies, in that when the faithful failed, he then ſaith, <hi>Now will I ariſe, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 12. 5. And on a like account, and in the incouragement of his ſpecial readineſs to receive thoſe that come, at ſuch a time when there is none ſhut up or left, that might here be comforters to them, the Prophet reſolves to look to the Lord, and wait for him, <hi>My God will hear me, when I ſit in darkneſs</hi> (when thoſe inſtruments that have ſhined as ligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>2. His ability and faithfulneſs to keep them committed to him (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2.) and this hath alſo been evidenced in what hath been ſaid; he is the wiſe God, and our Saviour, who is able to keep them from falling, through his powerful word, the word of his grace, and to preſent them faultleſs before the preſence of his glory, <hi>Jude.</hi> 24, 25. he hath wonderfully manifeſted his faithfulneſs in what he hath ſuffered and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured for us, and we are inſtructed to conſider him who was faithful to him that appointed him, and to be always look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him who indured the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame; and therein we may behold, and be fully aſſured of his faithfulneſs in perfecting whatſoever concerns us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 1, 2. &amp; 12. 2. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 1, 3. and he is able to do exceeding abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly above all we ask or think; the Father hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all judgement to him, and ſo infinitely loved him, becauſe he humbled himſelf, and became obedient to death, even the death of the Croſs, that he hath not given the Spirit by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure unto him, but hath filled him immeaſurably therewith, and hath given all things into his hand, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 22. &amp; 3. 34, 35. with Chap. 10. 17, 18. yea, herein is imported his ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and readineſs to aſſiſt them, and diſpenſe unto them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their needs and capacities, whatſoever was good, unto all their ſervices and ſufferings, and unto the utmoſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102274:46"/>
of them, that they might be preſerved blameleſs unto his coming, and ſo not fail of his grace, 1 <hi>Theſ. 5. 23, 24. Heb.</hi> 7. 25.</p>
            <p>2. As with reſpect to himſelf who now commended them, even the Apoſtle, there is ſignified.</p>
            <p>1. That he had the care of theſe lying upon him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed upon him came daily the care of all the Churches; he was a ſteward, to whom a great truſt was committed, and it is probable was the firſt that planted the Goſpel among them, and ſo might be an inſtrumental father of them, and now he ſhews his love to theſe who had firſt given themſelves to the Lord, and afterwards to him and his fellow-labourers by the will of God, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5. and his faithfulneſs to his Lord, in returning the charge of them to him from whom he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it: herein imitating our Saviour, the great ſhepherd of the Sheep; <hi>Thine they were,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and thou gaveſt them me, and now I am no more in the world, but theſe are in the world, and I come unto thee, holy father, keep through thine own name thoſe whom thou haſt given me,</hi> Joh. 17. 6, 11, 13. And thus our Brother, who was counted faithful, and put into the Miniſtry, and had a truſt committed to him, when departing to ſhew his faithfulneſs to the chief ſhepherd, and love to the ſheep, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned his charge to him from whom he had received it.</p>
            <p>2. His aſſurance of his faithfulneſs and ability to whom he commends them, it was to him whom he knew by experience to be gracious, and had proved faithful in all things, who had been exceeding abundantly gracious to him, and had ſtood by him and ſtrengthned him; even as <hi>Iſrael</hi> bleſſed <hi>Jacob,</hi> and intimately commends him and his to one whoſe faithfulneſs he had proved. <hi>The God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which fed me all my life long unto this day, the Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bleſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 15, 16. He knew whom he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and he was perſwaded that he was able to keep that which he committed to him againſt that day, as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12. he was well aſſured of, and ſatisfied in his infinite faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and therefore ſafely truſts in him, and commends theſe unto him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>3. As with reſpect to them whom he commends, he may intimate unto us,</p>
            <p>1. That they were children, ſuch as had not attained, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102274:47"/>
were already perfect, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12. and could not keep themſelves; they were all little children, though there might be diverſity among themſelves, ſome fathers, experienced believers who might be inſtruments of begetting others through the Goſpel; and ſome young men, who were ſtrong, having the word of God abiding in them, and ſome weak and babes; yet in this reſpect all little children, they had not yet attained to perfection, as 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 12, 14, 18. they yet needed a tutor, but not ſuch as they were under during the miniſtration of the Law, in which, though ſons, they differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing from ſervants; but ſuch an one as became ſons, even C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>riſt as a Son over his own houſe, and the word of his grace, and ſo the Law of faith, and not of works; they were not perfect as to attainment, and therefore needed to be committed to one who would be careful of, and faithful to them; yea, and that they had many enemies, who would indeavour to corrupt them from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt, and if poſſible defraud them of their inheritance, and ſo beguil them of their reward; many evil men, violent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and many ſeducers that would indeavour to pervert them, and ſubvert their ſouls, by removing them from him who had called them into the grace of Chriſt; they were weak in themſelves, and had ſtrong enemies, whoſe end was deſtruction, and therefore they needed an helper.</p>
            <p>2. To inſtruct them to commit themſelves to, and leave themſelves with him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 14. to ſubmit themſelves to God, and commit the keeping of their ſouls to him in well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, as unto a faithful Creator, and to be ordered, and guided, and taught by this Law of grace, and to have all their expectation from him and it, for their being kept by his power in this Goſpel through faith unto ſalvation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 19. &amp; 1. 5. And indeed this is the moſt p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rfect means by which he doth now help them, aſſiſt, inſtruct and ſtrengthen them, and preſerve them from evil; the Goſpel of Chriſt is the power of God unto ſalvation to every one that believeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16. This is the way whereby he keeps the ſouls of thoſe committed to him; ſo much may be ſignified to us in this, That when the congregation of God's poor cry out to him, <hi>Help Lord, for the godly man ceaſeth,</hi> &amp;c. God doth then create the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

comfortable to them, in firſt aſſuring them that in commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves to him, he would care for them, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them; and then he, or the Prophet in his name, directs them where they might meet with his gracious keeping, guidance and preſervation; he will ſet his poor and needy ones in ſafety, but wherewith and where may they expect this, ſo as to commit themſelves and way thereto? The words of the Lord (of, or concerning the Lord, in which is ſhewed that he is the Lord, and by what means he is ſo become, and the grace of God in him, and ſo the words that are ſpoken by the Lord, in the words of the Holy Ghoſt, and not which mans wiſdom teacheth) are pure words; that is, they are pure in themſelves, in what they teſtifie of the Lord, and of all things, faithful words, there is no lye of them; and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all acceptation; they give a true and right diſcovery of all things, and a good and gracious report of the Lord; and they are pure in their effect and efficacy, inlightning the eyes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 7, 8. and purifying the heart, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 19. and ſo purifying from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, <hi>Jam. 3. 17. Joh.</hi> 15. 3. by this means then God ſaves and helps, even by his words, and therefore he is commending them to us, that we might in them, and by them expect his performing all things for us. Now then in that he ſaith, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, therein is imported to us, that his deſire and counſel was, that they ſhould betake themſelves to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this faithful word for and unto all things, and not wander herefrom as a bird from her neſt, but even ſay with rejoycing as they, <hi>Jer. 3. 22. Behold we come unto thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>3. In that he now commends them to God, when he was to be taken from their head, as it were (as 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 3, 5.) and when he had ſignified ſome jealouſie concerning them, or ſome of them, as <hi>ver.</hi> 30. he may ſignifie unto them, that now it behoved them, and they needed to commit themſelves more immediately to God, and the word of his grace then formerly, and to take heed to themſelves ſingly and jointly, as <hi>ver.</hi> 28. and not too much confide one in another, leſt both he that helpeth fall, and they who are holpen fall, and both fail together; ſuch an underſtanding may agree with other places of Scripture, in which ſuch cauſes of lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102274:48"/>
are preſented; ſo much I conceive, is ſignified in that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12. by that cry lifted up to God: <hi>Help Lord, for the godly man ceaſeth, for the faithful</hi> (even ſuch whoſe ſpirits were fixed, and hearts united to proclaim God's goodneſs to the children of men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 6. theſe) fail from among the children of men; there were ſome of the congregation of God's poor and needy left, who thus pour out their hearts; but as perſons ſenſible there were none of ſuch uſefulneſs and faithfulneſs left behind, none in whom they could ſo ſafely truſt, or to whom they could ſo ſecurely commit themſelves, as they could have done to thoſe taken away, they therefore more immediately apply themſelves to the Lord, and joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intreat his mercy: <hi>Ariſe, O Lord, for our helpfulneſs, ſtand up for us, for our faithful helpers are gone, and we have none like them left behind:</hi> And the Lord, as moved with bowels to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, graciouſly anſwers, and ſaith; <hi>Now will I ariſe, ſaith the Lord, becauſe of the ſighing of the needy;</hi> as intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that while theſe faithful ones were preſerved, he had committed the care to them, as it were, and took his reſt, and even ſate him down, but now there were none like them he had taken away, or like minded to them, he would ariſe for their help, and keep them in ſafety by his words from thoſe that would inſnare them, as is before ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 5.

Or not faithful in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provings, but have either omitted the rebuking of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, when need required, and ſo hated them, and ſuffered ſin upon them, <hi>Lev. 19. 17.

Or if they be more upright hearted than the generality, yet you can put no ſuch confidence in their openings and applyings of the teſtimony of Chriſt, as you might have done in the good mans who is removed; <hi>therefore,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>I will look to the Lord,</hi> namely, more immediately, and incourageth himſelf with this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, my God with hear me; even now eſpecially he will prepare his ear to hear me, and be a light to me now the good man is periſhed (like that before in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.) and cryes, feed thy flock, eſpecially now the good man is periſhed, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 5, 8 14.

Upon the account of his being taken away, and ſo for our inſtruction when God removes faithful and eminent watchmen. 2. And that they might feed the flock of God, and ſo for believers edifying one another more generally.</p>
            <p>1. As with reſpect to his being taken away, and ſo for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102274:49"/>
to us when God removes faithful and eminent watchmen in the midſt of their dayes; what I ſhall ſpeak under this head will be of more direct reſpect to our ſelves to whom God hath been ordering ſuch an occaſion of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and lamentation; and ſo let us now commit our ſelves to God as with reſpect to them ſo taken away, and as with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to our ſelves that yet are preſerved in the Land of the living.</p>
            <p>1. As with reſpect to them ſo taken away, let us betake our ſelves to God, and to the word of his grace, that we ſorrow not for them as thoſe that have no hope; it is far better with them as is before ſaid, they ſleep in Jeſus, and are delivered from thoſe ſorrows, troubles and diſquietments that here they were expoſed to. Hence the Prophet, when he had been ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>The righteous periſheth, and merciful men are taken away,</hi> adds, from the evil; and <hi>He ſhall enter into peace, they ſhall reſt in their beds,</hi> &amp;c. as that which was proper to comfort the contrite one, and his mourners, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 1, 2.

Wherefore comfort one another with theſe words,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 14, 18. And oh that the conſolations of God may not be ſmall with us on this account.</p>
            <p>2. As with reſpect to our ſelves who are yet preſerved in the Land of the living, let us on ſuch an occaſion commit and betake our ſelves to him for his gracious teaching us out of his Law what we ſee not by any light that is in us as of us, or what we have forgotten, or let ſlip; that we may know wherefore he is ordering ſuch great and heavy teſtimonies of diſpleaſure, that we may be contrite, and humble our ſelves before him, and be broken off from what he hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving us for; doubtleſs in acquainting our ſelves with him, and the word of his grace, and its inſtructions, we may know wherefore he is thus pleading with us; thereby he is teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>Yea, this receiving his grace in vain ſo provokes God, as that he will hide his face, and will not hear, or take notice of their crying unto him ſo as to give gracious returns, how fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſoever they ſeem to be therein; yea, though they faſt and pray, and ſeek him daily, and delight to know his ways and take delight in approaching to God, yet he will not hear: So God himſelf by his Prophet in his anſwer to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of ſuch ſignifies; <hi>Wherefore have we faſted,</hi> ſay they, <hi>and thou ſeeſt not? wherefore have we afflicted our ſoul, and thou takeſt no knowledge?

yea, when his people, who have his name upon them, love to wander and refrain not their feet, it provokes him to be as a man aſtonied, as a mighty man that cannot ſave; and though they faſt and cry, yea, and though his faithful ſervants pray for his mercy for them, yet he will not hear, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 7, 9, 10, 12. with Chap. 15. 1. yea, when men bleſs themſelves in their hearts, concluding they ſhall have peace, though they walk in the imagination of their heart, to add drunkenneſs to thirſt, and ſo abuſe the goodneſs of God, and turn his grace into wantonneſs, continuing in ſin becauſe grace hath abounded, this provokes God greatly to angry, and cauſeth him to ſmoak, even againſt the prayers of ſuch, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 19, 20. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80. 4.</p>

            <p>2. More particularly, the cauſe of God's taking away his faithful ſervants untimely, and in anger to the ſurvivers is, becauſe thoſe to whom ſuch have propheſied cannot indure ſound doctrine, but have been angry with, and ſecretly, at leaſt, haters of faithful reproofs, and reprovers, this is an iniquity which is very provoking to God, when thoſe that are hearers reſolve not to give heed to their words in which they are faithfully admoniſhing of what is evil, and ſhewing to them the bitter fruit of going on ſtill in their treſpaſſes, and that whoſo walketh in crooked paths ſhall know no peace, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. 15, 18, 23.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102274:52"/>
the night. This hating reproof is an iniquity of ſuch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as in which men do even declare ſome ſtiff purpoſe and reſolvedneſs to continue in the things reproved; not a wandring ſimply, but a loving to wander; it is a ſure evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that a man is out of, and forſakes the way while cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is grievous unto him, while he loves not one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 10, 12. it keeps ſuch an one from going unto, or abiding amongſt the wiſe, the company of ſuch as are wiſe reprovers is a burden to them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 12, 31. 32. and therefore this perſiſted in, will at laſt provoke God to ſay as he did concerning, <hi>Ephraim, Let them alone;</hi> yea, and becauſe their heart is ſet on their iniquity, and they will not be made clean, give them ſuch teachers as will ſooth them up, ſuch as are Prophets of the deceit of their own heare, that will cry peace, peace unto them, and flatter them, telling them they are the temple of the Lord, and no evil ſhall come unto them. So he threatens that when his people were come to that bad condition that they would not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, but their heart was ſet on their iniquity, he would ſo order it in his judgments that there ſhould be like people, like Prieſts; and that he would herein puniſh them for their wayes, and reward them their doings, and even choſe their deluſions, as they could not indure thoſe that ſpake upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but rather deſired and ſpoke well of thoſe that daubed them up with untempered mortar, ſo he would take away the faithful ones from amongſt them, or give them charge to let them alone, and ſet ſuch over them as would be like unto themſelves, and ſtrengthen them in, or not pull them out of their evil way, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 4, 8, 9, 17. So alſo when the houſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> were come to that paſs, that they ſaid to them that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, propheſie not unto us right things, as before, he then threatens this as a judgment to them: <hi>If a man walking in the ſpirit and falſhood do lye, ſaying, I will propheſie unto thee of wine and ſtrong drink; he ſhall even be the Prophet of this people, Mic.</hi> 2. 6, 11. Oh heavy judgment ordered for a great and heinous iniquity; becauſe men love to be well ſpoken of, and to whatever crooked path they are walking in, and what will this come to in the iſſue? as <hi>Jer. 5. 30, 31. A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the Land; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets propheſie faſely—and my people love to have it ſo, and what will ye do in the end thereof?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:102274:53"/>Yea and this cauſeth God to ſhut out mens prayers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they hate his reproofs, and his faithful reprovers, and when they cry he will not hear them, but will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themſelves ill in their doings, <hi>Mic.</hi> 2. 6, 11. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 4. So the Lord threatens; <hi>They ſhall call upon me, but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not find me; for that they hated knowledge and did not chuſe the fear of the Lord; they would none of my counſel, they deſpiſed all my reproof; therefore they ſhall eat the fruit of their own way,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 28, 30. So much alſo may be contained in that Proverb; <hi>Poverty and ſhame ſhall be to him that refuſeth inſtruction,</hi> viz. that regards not reproof, as appears by the latter part of the verſe; that is, poverty in ſpiritual things ſhall be to ſuch an one, God will put an end to the Harveſt, and he ſhall beg in Winter, and have nothing; poverty ſhall come upon him as an armed man, and want as one that travelleth. And ſhame, God will put ſuch to ſhame, to wit, hide himſelf from them, and caſt them off, and be as one that is aſleep, he will lightly eſteem them, and though they cry and ſhout, yet he will ſhut out their prayers; but he that regardeth reproof ſhall be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured: God will honour ſuch an one, he will inrich him with durable riches and righteouſneſs, he ſhall get under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and his ear ſhall be alwayes opened to his cry, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 18. with <hi>Pſal. 44. 9, 23, 24. &amp; 89, 45, 46. Prov.</hi> 15. 32.</p>
            <p>3. More particularly, this provokes God to take away the righteous and faithful ones, becauſe their heart goeth after its covetouſneſs who are hearers of the Word, becauſe ſuch as theſe love the world, and the things of this world, and go on in purſuing this evil inclination, in oppreſſion or unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifulneſs in not doing good to others with what God hath been putting into their hands, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 31, 33. The love of money is the root of all evil, not only of the evil of ſin, but alſo of judgment and affliction; and it appears that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth include that alſo in the evil of which covetouſneſs is the root; for he ſaith, which while ſome have coveted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have erred from the faith; (this is a great iniquity, and that which leads to many other iniquities) and pierced themſelves with many ſorrows (cauſed much grief, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured many judgments to themſelves) 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9, 10. So
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:102274:53"/>
when the Prophet had been ſaying, The righteous periſheth, &amp;c. and merciful men are taken away, the Lord (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) ſhews that this was the cauſe of this judgment: <hi>For the iniquity of his covetouſneſs I was wroth and ſmote him, I hid me and was wroth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 1, 17. This iniquity followed after cauſeth men to hate faithful reprovers, and ſo provokes God to take them away, <hi>Mic.</hi> 2. 2, 6. yea, this being inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto, and perſiſted in, and ſuffered to bring forth its fruits, will even procure that great judgment of depriving ſuch of, or of the uſefulneſs of all faithful helpers, or ſuch as have the words of wiſdom fitted in their lips for ſpeaking profitably unto others; ſo, for this, the Lord threatens, <hi>Amos 8. 3, 13. The ſongs of the temple ſhall be howlings in that day, ſaith the Lord God, &amp;c. Hear this ye that ſwallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the Land to fail, ſaying, when will the new Moon be gone that we may ſell corn, and the Sabbath that we may ſet forth wheat?</hi> (when will thoſe appointed days and meetings be over, that we may follow and ſeek after our profit, that we may buy, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Yea this, and its direct fruits, provokes God to ſhut out mens cryes, even the oppreſſions of thoſe upon whom God's name is called, and their want of pity and mercy; their with-holding more then is meet tendeth to poverty, even to poverty in ſpiritual things; it provokes God to take away or with-hold ſuch faithful helps for their growth, as they might have had, and ſuch betruſting with the true riches as might have been committed to them; If therefore, ſaith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to his Diſciples, ye have not been faithful in the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous

            <p>Yea, with that light alſo let us examine our ſelves in and by the judgments he hath been ordering to us; for many times he doth ſo bring his judgments to light as that he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reveals our ſin, and writes it upon the rod, in doing to us what we have done to others, <hi>Judg.</hi> 1. 7.

            <p>Have we not been ſetting our hearts upon the world, and the things thereof, that we might heap up for our ſelves, and ſhut up the bowels of our compaſſion, when the needs of our brethren have been preſented to us, and God working in us both to will and to do?

us in the word of the Lord had too much cauſe to ſay to ſome; <hi>Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as Kings without us—ye are honourable, but we are deſpiſed; we hunger and thirſt—and labour, working with our own hands;</hi> and too little cauſe to ſay of any, their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. Oh that there were not cauſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to ſay, from the leaſt to the greateſt, <hi>Every one is given to covetouſneſs.</hi> How few are there that have been willing to promote the Goſpel of Chriſt to their power, and have been faithful in the leaſt things?</p>
            <p>Yea, and how much have we been walking in pride and high thoughts of our ſelves, and in thoſe fruits of it, ſuch as anger, wrath, diviſions, contentions, debates, whiſperings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Lord, be merciful unto me, heal my ſoul, for I have ſinned.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs the thus examining our ſelves in the light of the Lord is a more meet exerciſe for us to be exerciſed unto, than to cry out of the affliction ſimply. Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the puniſhment of his ſin? it is the puniſhment of his ſin that he ſuffers, why doth he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complain for the puniſhment, and mean time too much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that which procures it? <hi>Let us ſearch and try our wayes,</hi> this is a more meet exerciſe for us, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 39, 40. Why cryeſt thou for thine affliction? thy ſorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity, becauſe thy ſins were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed I have done theſe things to thee, ſaith the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. 15. See what God ſaith to <hi>Joſhua</hi> when he rent his cloaths, fell to the earth upon his face—and ſaid, <hi>Alas, O Lord God, wherefore hast thou brought this people over</hi> Jordan, <hi>to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us into the hand of the</hi> Amorites <hi>to deſtroy us?—What wilt thou do unto thy great name? and the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Joſhua, <hi>get thee up, wherefore lyeſt thou thus upon thy face?</hi> (complaining of the affliction) <hi>Iſrael hath ſinned, and they have tranſgreſſed—up, ſanctifie the people,</hi> &amp;c. As if he ſhould ſay, is there not a cauſe for what I have done? am I not provoked hereto? up and be doing, in ſearching and diligently inquiring what that is that hath procured theſe things unto you, and ſanctifie your ſelves, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. 7, 10, 15. So the Lord ſaith to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple when he was judging of them, becauſe his houſe lay waſte, and they run every man to his own houſe; or as now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And in and with our ſearching, and trying our wayes, let us turn again unto the Lord whom we have revolted, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 40. Let us not liſten unto the deceitfulneſs of ſin in us, which is the indeavouring to ſlay us, ſo as to harden our hearts and ſay, there is no hope, the caſe is deſperate, we have loved ſtrangers, and after them we will go, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 25. though we have done all this wickedneſs, yet turn not aſide from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Lord, but ſerve the Lord with all your heart, and turn ye not aſide, for then ſhould ye go after vain things which cannot profit, nor deliver, for they are vain, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 20, 25. even turn unto him from our iniquities, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, and confeſſing them as reproved, and diſcovered, and lay them apart in the light and ſtrength of his grace. And to move hereto.</p>
            <p>Remember how great things he hath done for us when we were dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, and juſtly baniſhed from his preſence in the righteous ſentence of his Law; he then remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred us in our low eſtate, for his mercy indureth for ever, and deviſed a bleſſed means that his baniſhed might not be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and for ever expelled from him, hold the beginning of our confidence ſtedfaſt unto the end: Behold, he hath given his Son for a witneſs to the people of the greatneſs and ſincerity of his love to us; let us then remember that Jeſus Chriſt who was delivered for us all, was raiſed from the dead according to the Goſpel; and let us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And herewith alſo conſider that there is mercy with the Lord, and with him is plenteous redemption through his blood, even the forgiveneſs of our ſins, according to the riches of God's grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 7. there is forgiveneſs with him, not that we ſhould continue in ſin that grace may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, but that he may be feared, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. 3, 4, 7. even forgiveneſs of the ſins reproved, and waſhing, and cleanſing from them. Oh, let us then turn unto him and ſay, take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102274:58"/>
all iniquity, and receive us graciouſly, heal our back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings, and love us freely; he is merciful and will not keep anger for ever, only let us acknowledge our iniquity, that we have tranſgreſſed againſt him. This is powerful to purge guile out of our ſpirits, and preſerve us from it, which leads us to keep ſilence, and to hide, that we may hold faſt the things reproved, that he is a God ready to pardon; and for this cauſe ſhall every one that is godly pray unto him in a time of finding, <hi>Pſal. 32. 2. 6. Neh.</hi> 9. 17. In this incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement let us yet look again toward his holy Temple, <hi>Jonah</hi> 2. 2, 7.</p>
            <p>Yea, conſider that the end of the Lord is gracious in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ſuch great judgments, while it is called to day, and ſo much the Apoſtle particularly ſignifies when he had been ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>For this cauſe many are weak and ſickly among you, and many ſleep</hi>—He adds; <hi>But when we are judged</hi> (namely with ſuch judgments, and that becauſe we have not timely judged our ſelves) <hi>we are chaſtened of the Lord, that we ſhould not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with the world,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 30, 32. His end herein is good, that he might awaken us to his righteouſneſs, and cauſe us to ariſe from the dead, that Chriſt may give us light, that he may keep back our ſouls from the pit, and we may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned with the light of the living. And it is infinitely bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be now judged, and to ſubmit to him therein, and bear patiently his indignation, than to be condemned hereafter, and ſentenced to, and puniſhed in that lake, where their worm dyeth not, and their fire is not quenched.</p>
            <p>Yea, in thus ſearching and trying our wayes, and turning unto him in the incouragement of the multitude of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, humbling our ſelves before him, and confeſſing our vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſinfulneſs; hereby we ſhall aſcribe righteouſneſs to our Maker, and give glory to him. <hi>My ſon,</hi> ſaid <hi>Joſhua, give, I pray thee glory to the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and make confeſſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and tell what thou haſt done, hide it not,</hi> Joſh. 7. 19. While men are pleading their innocency, or hiding their ſin, and crying out only of the affliction, they therein indeavour to diſannul his judgment, and condemn him that they may be righteous, <hi>Job</hi> 40. 8. whereas in a right examining our ſelves in the light of the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Such as ſit in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death—Becauſe they rebelled againſt the words of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned the counſel of the moſt high; therefore he brought down their heart with labour, they fell down and there was none to help; then they cryed unto the Lord in their trouble, and he ſaved them out of their diſtreſſes: He brought them out of darkneſs, and the ſhadow of death—Oh that men would praiſe the Lord for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—for he hath broken the gates of braſs, and cut the bars of iron in ſunder.</hi> And, <hi>whoſo is wiſe, and will obſerve theſe things, even they ſhall underſtand the loving kindneſs of the Lord.</hi> Pſal. 107. 10, 16, 43. Oh that we may not be tempting God, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting the holy one of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſay, can he help us? can he repair our breaches? but conſider what he hath done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and in that incouragement, and as that is working in us both to will and to do; <hi>Come and let us return to the Lord, for he hath torn and he will heal us, he hath ſmitten, and he will bind us up,</hi> Hoſ. 6. 1, 2. <hi>Iſa. 57. 1, 15, 18.

            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:102274:59"/>Yea, and be we admoniſhed to examine our ſelves, and to return to him in confeſſing our ſins, leſt we provoke him to make further breaches upon us, leſt his ſoul depart from us, and he make us utterly deſolate of our glory, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 8. For if we be not reformed by theſe liftings up of his hand, but ſtill walk contrary to him, he will proceed in walking contrary to us, and will yet puniſh us, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 21, 24. ſuch like ſtrokes as theſe are not only great judgments in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but alſo fore-runners of greater; ſo when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet was declaring the greatneſs of ſuch a judgment as in which there was none to guide <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> among all the ſons ſhe had brought forth; namely, that it was an heavy teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God's diſpleaſure, ſuch as in which ſhe had drank at the Lord's hand, the cup of his fury, the dregs of the cup of trembling wrung out; he then ſignifies that this was alſo the forerunner and concomitant of greater judgments, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he adds, <hi>Theſe two things are come unto thee, who ſhall be ſorry for thee? deſolation, and deſtruction, and the famine (viz.</hi> that alſo of hearing of the words of the Lord) <hi>and the ſword,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51. 17, 19.

Oh that the conſideration of all might awaken us to gather our ſelves together, before the decree bring forth, before the day paſs as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon us, before the day of the Lords anger come upon us, that we may ſeek the Lord, ſeek righteouſneſs and meekneſs, that either he may graciouſly turn away his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and judgments further threatned; or however we may be hid in the day of the Lord's anger, <hi>Zeph. 2. 1, 3.

            <p>2. He now commits theſe to God, and the word of his grace, that they might take heed to themſelves, and to the flock, to feed them; as <hi>ver.</hi> 28.

with the great Shepherd, and the Word of his grace, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing helpfulneſs herein, even wiſdom, ſtrength, and direction to all their ſervice, for in Chriſt as declared in the Goſpel, they may be furniſhed unto every good word and work; in this perſon and thing to which he commends them, they might be every way furniſhed for feeding and edifying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and one another; in Chriſt as manifeſted in the word, and ſo in the word of Chriſt, there is given matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to ſeed; inſtruction to the manner how to feed, and motive to move hereto.</p>
            <p>1. Matter wherewith to feed, namely to nouriſh them up with the words of faith (in which Chriſt is declared to be the Author and finiſher of the faith) and of good doctrine, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 6. that they might grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. the thing wherewith they might feed them, it was the Goſpel of Chriſt, as opened according to the revelation of the myſtery, in which is the ſincere milk, whereby men may grow, and be nouriſhed up, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. And ſo the Apoſtle in this his exerciſe in direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them on ſuch an occaſion, to God &amp; the word of his grace, was a follower of God, &amp; gave ſuch inſtruction to theſe, as God gave to the leaders of the people in former <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>imes, to whom he ſaid, <hi>This is the rest</hi> (even that foundation laid in <hi>Zion) where ye may cauſe the weary to reſt,</hi> and this is the refreſhing; namely, that matter wherewith they might refreſh thoſe to whom they ſpake, in directing them to the viſion of all, even to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt as he was witneſſed in the Law and the Prophets, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 12, 16. Theſe are Paſtors after God's own heart, that feed with knowledge, <hi>viz.</hi> with the doctrine of Chriſt, and with underſtanding, with skilfulneſs in the word of God's righteouſneſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 15. To this then he commits them as to that wherewith they might do all their work; for the Goſpel of Chriſt is the power of God to ſalvation to every one that believeth. So the Apoſtle charges <hi>Timothy, Preach the word</hi> (namely, the Word of truth, the Goſpel of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) <hi>be instant in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 2.

their whole work of diſcipling, <hi>Mat. 28. 19, 20. Mark 16. 15. Luk.</hi> 24. 46, 48. and ſo they did preach, even Jeſus Chriſt, and not themſelves, or the Law, <hi>Rom. 10. 8.

Surely this word of God's grace is a compleat doctrine, both for opening the eyes of the blind, and turning to the Lord, and for perfecting them that do believe, ſo as there is no need for preaching the Law, either at firſt to prepare men for Chriſt, or afterwards, to perfect that by the fleſh which was begun by the Spirit: In Chriſt, as declared in the teſtimony, ye are compleat, &amp;c. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3, 10.

            <p>This is that food then wherewith they might feed, even with the Goſpel of Chriſt, in which is ſpiritually given to us his fleſh, which is meat indeed, and his blood which is drink indeed; and ſo here they might be inſtruments of cauſing the flock to lye down in green paſtures; this God, even our God, being alwayes with this word of his grace, in the plain and faithful miniſtration of it, to give himſelf to us to feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even his fleſh which he hath given for the life of the world.

And truly we all need to be admoniſhed of this evil, for men naturally love and admire the wiſdom of this world; and oh that there were not too much cauſe to ſay that many of God's people are too much polluted with this iniquity.

themſelves, while judging and walking as men, may have ſuch a good opinion of them as to fall too much in love with them, and to count them their enemies who give a true diſcovery of them; <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 16: and occaſion grief to thoſe that are over them in the Lord, and admoniſh them, becauſe they are ſo hardly perſwaded to beware of them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 18. judge not according to appearance, ſaith our Saviour, but judge righteous judgment, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 24. as ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, the judging according to appearance is not righteous judgment; for, ſuch as are the enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt may have a beautiful outſide; do ye look on things after the outward appearance, ſaith the Apoſtle, when he is warning of deceitful workers, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 7. This is the way to be miſtaken and deceived.</p>
            <p>But, by their fruits is meant,</p>
            <p>1. The fruits of their l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ps, even thoſe divers and ſtrange doctrines which they bring, in which they cauſe to err from the words of knowledge: And this appears to be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, and not their outward appearance; becauſe ſuch have ſheeps cloathing, as is ſaid before; as well as alſo it is a direction for knowing, not evil perſons in general, but falſe Prophets in particular: Now, how ſhould they be known ſo well as by their ſtrange voice? and a ſtrange voice it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to hear perſons that appear to be, and are by many ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for ſheep, and have ſheeps cloathing upon them, to bark like wolves againſt the Shepherd, and the Teſtimony of Chriſt; to appear like a Lamb, and ſpeak as a Dragon, as is ſaid of the man of ſin, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 11. and this underſtanding of it ſuits well with what our Saviour gives as the reaſon why the ſheep will not follow a ſtranger, which alſo he calls a wolf, namely, becauſe of their voice, and not their outſide appearance: <hi>A ſtranger,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they will not follow, but will flee from him, for they know not the voice of ſtrangers,</hi> Joh. 10. 4 5, 12. by their words then they may be diſcovered and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. And that this is meant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y fruits, will further appear by thoſe rules of direction given to know falſe Prophets by, by the Apoſtles: I ſhall particularly pitch upon thoſe two given by the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 1, 6. where he warns the believers not to believe eye y ſpirit, but to try the ſpirits whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are of God, becauſe many falſe Prophets are gone
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:102274:75"/>
out into the world. And that we may try them, he gives two rules for tryal, by which we may know them.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Every ſpirit that confeſſeth not Jeſus Chriſt come in the fleſh, is not of God, and this is that ſpirit of Antichriſt,</hi> ver. 3. So again, 2 <hi>Joh. 7. Many deceivers are entred into the world, who confeſs not Jeſus Chriſt come in the fleſh, this is a deceiver and an Antichrist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The perſon they confeſs not, is, Jeſus Chriſt which is come in the fleſh, and hath finiſhed the work which the Father gave him to do in his own body, even Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> who was born in the dayes of <hi>Ceſar Auguſtus,</hi> when <hi>Cyrenius</hi> was Governour of <hi>Syria,</hi> who was delivered for our offences, and raiſed again, in the ſame body in which he was crucified, the third day according to the Scriptures, as diſtinguiſhed from all other perſons and things.</p>
            <p>And by [<hi>confeſſing</hi>] is meant, an open and plain acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment that he hath come, with a praiſing, commending and ſpeaking honourably of him, according to the Scriptures, giving thanks unto him, or giving him the praiſe which is due unto him, and ſo thankfully acknowledging in their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, that he hath done ſuch things, &amp; is become, and is ſuch an one as the Father hath teſtified of him. So where it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal. 18. 49. I will give thanks unto thee,</hi> or praiſe thee; it is thus rendred, <hi>Rom. 15. 9. I will confeſs to thee among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> So where we read in <hi>Pſal. 107. 8, 15, 21, 31. Oh that men would praiſe the Lord.</hi> In every of theſe verſes in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer tranſlation, it is rendred, <hi>confeſs.</hi> So, <hi>Mat. 11. 25. At that time Jeſus ſaid, I thank,</hi> or praiſe thee, it is in the Margin, <hi>I confeſs,</hi> &amp;c. See alſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 15. So here, <hi>Every ſpirit that confeſſeth not Jeſus Chriſt which is come in the fleſh,</hi> that is, that praiſeth not, magnifieth n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, lifteth not up, celebrateth not him, is not of God. We may inſtance a little particularly.</p>
            <p>1. Thoſe perſons confeſs not, praiſe not Jeſus Chriſt come in the fleſh who tell us, That the bread and wine in the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per when conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>crated, is tranſubſtantiated into the very body and blood of Chriſt: They hereby praiſe not that Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> that was born of the V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and dyed for our ſins at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and is raiſed again; but ſomewhat elſe in the room and ſtead of him, that was not then, nor many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ſince, in being; which was never crucified for us,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:102274:75"/>
never buried, never raiſed again as he was; yea, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly they lift up and magnifie themſelves, who think they can make their Saviour, and ſo are greater than he; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides they caſt him down from his excellency, for he is but one, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 14. 1 Cor.</hi> 8. 6. but of theſe it may be ſaid, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number of their Cities are their Chriſts, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 28.</p>
            <p>2. So alſo they confeſs not Jeſus Chriſt, who ſay, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our Lord Jeſus lyes where they laid it, and is turned to duſt, and rottenneſs, and that he is not raiſed from the dead in that ſame body in which he bare our ſins on the Tree; but call ſome light, ſpirit, or ſeed in every man, the Chriſt, in ſomedying, in others riſing, &amp;c. Theſe deny Jeſus to be the Chriſt, and ſo are Antichriſts, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 22. and even call him accurſed, one who hath failed in the work appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to do, and hath not redeemed us from the curſe of the Law; for if Chriſt be not raiſed from the dead in that ſame body in which he died for our ſins, according to the Scriptures, and was buried; then is our preaching vain, ſaith the Apoſtle, and your faith is alſo vain, ye are yet in your ſins, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 3, 4, 12, 20. They ſpeak indeed many times of a Chriſt, but they deny or confeſs not him who is ſo indeed; for he is one who ſhewed himſelf alive after his ſuffering by many infallible proofs, and roſe in that ſame body in which he was crucified (though not in the weakneſs it was ſometime in) in that body which hath fleſh and bones, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 24. Joh. 2. 21. Act. 1. 3.

Heb.</hi> 2. 9. and ſo ſuch as deny him to be the ſtanding propitiation for the ſins of the whole world, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 2. Theſe teach men to deny the Lord that bought them; yea, they are led by the ſpirit of error, who confeſs not, praiſe not, lift not up Jeſus Chriſt, as the Son of God, the Saviour of the world; they come not up to whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom words, for the true Chriſt is the Saviour of the world, even of mankind, and this began to be ſpoken by the Lord himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16, 17. &amp; 4. 42. &amp; 6. 51. and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15, 19. and ſo the Son of God is the Saviour of the world; and this was the ſum of the Apoſtles teſtimony, which they had received, and ſaw in the evidence and demonſtration of the Spirit, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 13, 15. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a Preacher of this, <hi>viz.</hi> That God will have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4, 7. and inſtructed <hi>Timothy</hi> to hold faſt the form of ſound words, which he heard of him, that unto which he was ordained a Preacher (as before) and an Apoſtle, <hi>viz.</hi> that God is one, and there is one Mediator between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus; who gave himſelf a ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due time; by which he proves and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences that God will have all men to be ſaved, &amp;c. I ſay, to hold this laſt, in faith, in an hearty belief of the truth of it, and in love to men, ſo as declaring this to them, and holding it faſt in profeſſion, according to the conſtraining operations of the grace of God in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Tim,</hi> 1. 9, 13. with 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4, 7. &amp; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 13, 15, 18, 20. and exhorted <hi>Timothy</hi> to command others to teach, and himſelf to teach, that the living God is the Saviour of all men, eſpecially of them that believe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10, 11. See alſo <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 15.</p>
            <p>And in this direction given unto us for tryal of ſpirits, that we may know ſo as to avoid falſe Prophets, it is obſervable, the Apoſtle doth not poſitively and particularly declare what
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:102274:77"/>
the falſe ſpirits do hold and teach; but in the general he ſaith, If they confeſs not, praiſe not, lift not up Jeſus Chriſt, or give not to him the glory due to him in their confeſſions, ſo as in all hearing the Apoſtles, they are not of God, and we are to beware of them; if they Evangelize otherwiſe than what the Apoſtles have Evangelized, we are to reject them; for if it be not the voice of our Shepherd, we may be ſure it is the voice of a ſtranger, and ſo we are to flee from them; yea, <hi>if any man come unto you,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>and bring not this doctrine</hi> (the doctrine of Chriſt in which he is lifted up in the words of the Holy Ghoſt) <hi>receive him not into your houſe, neither bid him God ſpeed:</hi> He ſaith not, if he take not up this doctrine, which he may ſeem to do for advantage ſake when he is with you, that he may not be diſcovered, but may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you; but if he bring it not, if this be not his meſſage, his errand when he comes, the thing he is ſet to promote, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him not, &amp;c. <hi>Prov. 14. 7. Joh. 10. 4, 5. 2 Joh.</hi> 7, 11.</p>
            <p>2. And by their fruits may be meant alſo the effects of their doctrines, which the Diſciples of Chriſt may perceive and diſcern, namely, that they are ſuch as tend to corrupt from that ſimplicity that is in Chriſt, to draw away mens hearts and affections from him who is the only foundation of faith and hope, the only fountain in whom dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily, the only bread of life, and door of approach to God. They tend to remove men from him that called them into the grace of Chriſt, and cauſe men to err from the words of knowledge, <hi>Prov. 19. 27. Gal.</hi> 1. 6. and this appears plainly in thoſe that imbrace and entertain thoſe confeſſions in which Jeſus Chriſt is not lifted up in the word of the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>Now then in applying our ſelves to God, and the word of his grace, we may be preſerved from thoſe grievous Wolves; for they confeſs not our God, or confeſs him not according to that diſcovery given of him in the word of his grace: Oh let us then keep ſound wiſdom and diſcretion, ſo ſhall they be life to our ſouls, preſerve our ſouls in life, and grace to our necks; then ſhall we walk in the way ſafely, and our foot ſhall not ſtumble, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 21, 26. take faſt hold of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, let her not go, keep her for ſhe is thy life, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:102274:78"/>3. That I may not over-much inlarge, I ſhall briefly ſay, the Apoſtle directs and commends them to this perſon and thing, that they might not ariſe ſpeaking perverſe things; and that they might be preſerved from thoſe amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that would ariſe ſpeaking perverſe things to draw away diſciples after them, <hi>ver.</hi> 30.

            <p>1. That amongſt thoſe whom the Holy Ghoſt hath made overſeers over the flock, ſome may poſſibly ariſe ſpeaking perverſe things, crooked wreathed things, ſuch as in which they would pervert the Goſpel of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 7. and that either by deſiring to be teachers of the Law, as there were ſome inclined hereto amongſt theſe believers, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 3, 7.

            <p>2. That the end of thoſe that ſpeak perverſe things is, to draw Diſciples after them, and herein they are diſtinguiſhed from the true Miniſters of Chriſt, the end of whoſe conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is, Jeſus Chriſt the ſame, yeſterday, to day, and for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7, 8.

have preheminence and maintainance: Whereas thoſe that are like minded with the Apoſtles, indeavour to eſpouſe men to Chriſt, that they may preſent them a chaſte Virgin to him; and aim at this, that God in all things may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified through Jeſus Chriſt, and in lifting up Jeſus Chriſt they ſeek the good of men, and eſpecial good of believers, though they be as reprobates, 2 <hi>Cor. 11. 2, 3. &amp; 13. 7. 1 Theſ.</hi> 2. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>3. That becauſe ſuch may ariſe ſpeaking perverſe things to draw away Diſciples after them, therefore it behoves others, yea, all believers to watch, that ſeeing they know this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they may not be removed from him that called them into the grace of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 17. Gal.</hi> 1. 6. It is good for them to take heed what they hear (eſpecially when God is removing faithful and eminent inſtruments) even from ſuch as are over them, <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 24. and not take things on truſt. Surely we are very ready, when once we have an high eſteem of men, to receive all for truth they ſay, and not to bring it to the light, and from hence much evil ſprings: for we rob Chriſt of that honour that appertains to him, and hurt our ſelves if we ſo receive what is ſaid, though it be truth we receive, while our faith ſtands in the wiſdom or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of men; and while we receive the word of God as the word of men, becauſe of our eſteem of their goodneſs, wiſdom, learning, it works not effectually in us, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 13. And if thoſe we ſo eſteem err from the truth, we are apted to follow them, and ſo the blind leading the blind, both fall into the ditch; good it is therefore to examine what ſuch ſay, that if it be truth, we may receive it as the word of God; if they ſpeak perverſe things, as they do when they conſent not to wholſom words, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 8.

            <p>4. That whereto we are to watch, that we may diſcern and avoid any perverſe things that may be ſpoken by ſome among our ſelves; it is God, and the word of his grace, as before is ſaid, by attending unto wiſdoms words, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining our ear unto her ſayings, &amp;c. we may put perverſe lips far from us, ſo as not to uſe them our ſelves, nor be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by others that have them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 20, 24. they are powerful to deliver us from the man that ſpeaks froward (or perverſe) things, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 1, 12. yea, if any ſhould turn away their ears from the truth, and be turned to fables, yet here-through believers may be inſtruments of ſaving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and them that hear them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16. Hence when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>They went out from us, but they were not of us,</hi> (namely, immediately before their departure; he ſaith not, they were never of us, but there was a ſecret departure in heart before they left them as to bodily preſence.) He adds, <hi>But ye have an unction from the holy one, (viz.</hi> the truth, Chriſt as declared in the Goſpel) <hi>and ye know all things—Let that abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning—And ye ſhall continue in the Son and in the Father</hi> (in their peculiar favour, care and protection) <hi>theſe things have I written unto you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them that ſeduce you, 1 Joh.</hi> 2. 19, 26. See alſo 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 1, 2. &amp; 3. 1, 2. Jude</hi> 18, 21. Believers need not that any man teach them (as to matter or manner) but as the anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the teſtimony of Chriſt, teacheth of all things, and is truth, and is no lye, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 27. to that therefore let us have our recourſe alwayes, and eſpecially when God is taking away, as here, eminent and faithful watchmen; we have then the more abundant need to have the great things of God's Law alwayes in remembrance (in which we may have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the Father and Son, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 3.) and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers might have theſe things alwayes in remembrance was the Apoſtles indeavour, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 12, 14. 1 Tim. 6. 12, 14. 2 Tim.</hi> 1. 8, 13. &amp; 2. 2.</p>
            <p>And though the gifts which Chriſt hath given to men be
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:102274:79"/>
very uſeful, and given to a gracious end; yet becauſe the perſons that have them are men ſubject to like paſſions with others, and ſo may poſſibly ſpeak perverſe things; good therefore it is for believers to pray for themſelves and one for another, that their love may abound in all knowledge and judgment, that they may try things that differ, and ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove things that are excellent, that they may be ſincere, and without offence till the coming of Chriſt, otherwiſe they will not ſo be, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 9, 10.

            <p>Oh! that we did more commit our ſelves to God, and the word of his grace, for his teaching and preſervation, that we might know what to hear and receive, and what to refuſe: Let us take faſt hold of inſtruction, and though thoſe that ſpeak perverſe things, pretend word as from the Apoſtles for what they ſay, yet let us not for trial of them, and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from them, wave the Goſpel, or ſeek help any where elſe, but ſtill hold faſt the things delivered which we have been taught by the Apoſtles, by word or Epiſtle; as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle inſtructs the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> when he beſeeches them not to be moved or troubled, neither by Spirit, Word, or Letter as from them, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 2, 15.

And hence he is called, the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, <hi>viz.</hi> that upon which they were built, they were begotten to a lively hope by the reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead, as this was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered of God in the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. and which they have doctrinally and Miniſterially laid, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner ſtone, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20. he was at firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by God when mankind had departed from him, in order to his being brought back again to him, in that firſt Oracle, <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the head of the Serpent, Gen.</hi> 3. 15.

            <p>This was the foundation on which they were built, even

Jeſus Chriſt, who by the grace of God taſted death for every man, and is raiſed again in the ſame body in which he was crucified and hanged on a Tree, according to the Scriptures, who is the foundation of God, and which ſtandeth ſure, and is laid for a foundation to them who are diſobedient; and is the foundation of all unfeigned believers. Hence he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>the beginning of our confidence,</hi> Heb. 3. 14. even of the Apoſtles, and of all believers confidence, for they have all but one beginning of their confidence, and that is Chriſt, <hi>who is the beginning, the firſt born from the dead, that in all things he ſhould have the preheminence,</hi> Col. 1. 18.

            <p>Many there are indeed who have as their foundation on which they are bottomed, and ſeed of which they are begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, ſomewhat that was not crucified for them; either the injoyment of his Word and Ordinances, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 26, 27. or that they have propheſied in his name, and in his name have caſt out Devils, and in his name have done many wonderful works, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 21, 23. but the having as the beginning of their confidence ſuch like things, is but building the houſe upon the ſand, which will deceive them, for he never knew or owned any that were built on theſe things, as he doth thoſe who are built upon Jeſus Chriſt the rock, as declared to us in the Goſpel. Compare <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 27. &amp; <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 23. with 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. and in truſting in theſe things, and being bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom'd hereon, they are workers of iniquity, and ſeek to caſt down Chriſt from his excellency, and to rob him of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Father hath given unto him, and which he will not give to any other perſon or thing.

God is now in his Goſpel gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly declaring that their righteouſneſs and their works ſhall not profit them, and by the weapons thereof pulling down mens ſtrong holds, caſting down imaginations, ſcaling the City of the mighty, and caſting down the ſtrength of the confidence thereof, that men might count what things are

            <p>Yea, and he is the foundation as diſtinguiſhed from the purpoſes and decrees of God, and ſo from any purpoſe of his which he hath purpoſed in himſelf concerning his loving ſome with peculiar manner of love: Indeed he was purpoſed from the beginning to be the foundation, and this was his decree, the ſum of his decrees concerning ſinful mankind, and out of the bowels of which all his decrees iſſue concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; that he would raiſe Chriſt in due time from the dead, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 7. and hath fulfilled the promiſe and purpoſe; but not his purpoſe and decree ſimply, but Jeſus Chriſt is the foundation, the one and only foundation, <hi>For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And this appears evidently from that place ſome men alledge to prove ſome purpoſe of God to be the foundation, <hi>viz.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>Nevertheleſs the foundation of God ſtandeth ſure,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>And as this inſtruction is for admonition to them that are built on this foundation of God, and made of this temple of the living God, that they ſhould be clean, and not defile the habitation of God which is holy (devoted and dedicated for peculiar uſe and ſervice to him) with any filthineſs of fleſh or ſpirit, leſt they provoke God to deſtroy them, and ſuffer the Boar out of the wood, and the wild beaſt of the field to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them, even thoſe grievous wolves before ſpoken of, for he cannot indure that his habitation ſhould be polluted, but holineſs becomes his houſe for ever, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 17, 18. 2 Cor.</hi> 6. 16, 17. &amp; 7. 1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 93. 5.</p>

            <p>2. The means whereby God in Chriſt by his Spirit doth ſanctifie, (as to perſons, I mean, that are come to years of capacity) are,</p>
            <p>1. The chief and principal <hi>medium,</hi> is, the word of his grace, in which is declared and commended to us the free grace of God in the blood of Jeſus Chriſt; Jeſus Chriſt is ſaid to ſanctifie with the waſhing of water by the word, even with the kindneſs and love of God our Saviour, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 26. and ſo he is ſaid to waſh in his blood, in which the love of God is commended, and men are ſaid to be ſanctified with the blood of the Covenant, <hi>Rev. 1. 5.

And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the principal means whereby men may be ſanctified, born again and ſaved, now it is by diſcovering and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the love of God to mankind, in lifting up the Son of man by the Spirit in the teſtimony: So our Saviour ſignifies in anſwer to <hi>Nicodem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Compare 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 1, 4. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 10, 11. So the Apoſtle ſignifies, that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:102274:90"/>
the means whereby he and other believers were ſaved from their ignorance, diſobedience, and ſerving divers luſts, it was by the appearance of the kindneſs and love of God our Saviour to man-ward, which is the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 3, 6. It is not the Law as a Law of works, or any obſervance thereof by men, or indeavouring to frame their hearts thereby to love God and men, and to avoid the evils forbidden, that is the way or means whereby God doth ſanctifie; nor is the Law firſt to be preached to the effecting this ſanctification; though men may ſeek to ſanctifie themſelves, and purifie themſelves thereby, and in ſo doing account themſelves Saints, and be ſo accounted by others, yet theſe are none of God's Saints, or ſanctified ones, but theſe ſhall be conſumed together, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 17 nor is it any peculiar manner of love to mens perſons in a perſonal conſideration firſt diſcovered to, or working in men before they believe, that is the means for effecting this ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but it is done by the Spirit in glorifying Chriſt, and therein commending God's love to the world, ſinners, and ungodly ones, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18, 23. this is the ſupream means.</p>

            <p>3.
